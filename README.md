# \<ANTventure: Lost in the Colony\>: Game Design Document
This document should provide a brief outline and direction for your game to get you thinking about the game that you want to design, how you will make it, and what you need to make?

For each of these provide at least a short paragraph describing each, unless otherwise noted:

## Vision Statement
	Our game places the player in the role of a black ant trying to survive in a dangerous environment filled with enemies and natural hazards. The vision is to create an adventurous and immersive experience where the player feels the challenges of being small and unfamiliar big world. 

## Gameplay 
### Mechanics
The player will control a black that will move cross the environment. They will be collect sugar cubes and other food items for points and health power-ups. The ant must avoid or overpower enemies like red ants, bed bugs, ladybugs and spiders. Water will serve as a major hazard, requiring the player to jump or use power-up to cross. A unique mechanic allows the ant to “hide” when enemies attack, adding strategy to survival.

### Scoring and/or Win / Lose Conditions
The main win condition is when the ant is successfully return to the anthill after gathering enough resources. Players lose a life when they are caught by enemies or fall into water and/or similar hazards. The game ends when the ants lives are lost.

The current score will be displayed at all times and show when the player either gains or lose points.
#### Gaining Points
Points are gained by collection food items, winning battles and collecting power-ups and equipment.
#### Losing Points
Points will be lost when the player takes damage i.e. losing fights and taking damage from hazards.

### Controls
The players will be using the arrow keys to move left, right and climb up and down. Additionally, they will be using the Spacebar to jump and using Z to hide. 

### Aesthetic
The overall aesthetic would be a simple pixel art style that depicts a cute and sily art style. Concept Art TBA

### Desired Player Experience
The player's overall experience wil be the accomplishment of getting to point A to B, there will be various roadblocks that will try and stop the player from achieving their goal.

## Game Characters
### The Black Ant!
The playable character (PC) will a black ant that doesn't have much backstory beside what is depicted in the game.
### NPCs
**Red ant colony** will be the primary antagonist in the prototype where the ant must manuever around or through to get home. 
Additionally there will be other NPCs that will either aide or try to halt the player's progress.
- The Spider
- The Lady Bug

## Story
There is minimal storytelling the game. Either written or shown will show that the ant gets away from his/her colony and must find her way back to her original. There will be many other bugs that will try to stand in the ant's goal of reuniting with his/her family.

## The Game World
The game will include the player being an ant that was accidentally brought home from a picnic. 
### Intro
The game will start with possibly a short cut scene if in-scope. The game will begin with the ant being in a dark house and will be leading out to the big backyard. The purpose of the intro will be teaching the player the controls.

### Backyard

The player will be walking out and will be introduced to an red ant colony. The red ant colony will be telling the black ant to leave but the player will have to fight the initial ant as a tutorial. From there the player will be walking to a tree to hopefully get out.

#### Tree
The tree will be a way for the player to practice the climbing mechanic and get a power-up equipment. 

#### Fence
The player will climb over the fence and if they don’t have the leaf boat, the ant will not be able to continue and must come back to the tree. 

### Water
This will be where the game ends and  shows the ant sailing off. 

## Media List
There will be a whimsical background audio that plays throughout the game.
More concept art shown: TBA
There will be sound effects for when the Ant gets hurt, gets points and possibly more as we expand the idea.
